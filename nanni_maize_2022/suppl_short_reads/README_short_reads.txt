* all_2_${REF}_${TYPE}_short_read_count_summary_w_prop.csv :
    Summary of short read alignment counts when mapped to B73 v4 (b73), Mo17
        Yan (mo17_yan), or Mo17 Cau (mo17_cau) reference genomes. Paired-end
        (TYPE = PE) and single-end (TYPE = SE) alignment summaries are
        provided separately with proportions of unmapped reads for each
        sample (5 genotypes x 2 treatments x 12 replicates = 120 samples).
