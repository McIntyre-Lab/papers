This is an example of input for the H12 analyses from (Garud et al. 2015). The 
file should be a CSV with position followed by the genotype for each individual.  
I have left the header in to show the columns, but it should be removed before 
using. Heterozygotes are masked as 'N'. I removed any positions that had 1 or 
more missing genotypes.
