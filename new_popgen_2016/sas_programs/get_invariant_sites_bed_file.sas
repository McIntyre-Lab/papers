/* For the Swedish R code 'getPopstat.R' I need a bed file with invariant site
 * positions. The only way I can think to get this is the following:
    1) Import a windowed VCF
    2) Make another file that counts 1 by 1 all the positions from vcf_start to vcf_end
        2b) Also, the next column should be col1+1, to give the position of each base
    3) Merge these files and output the sites that are not in the VCF
    4) This result should be like a bed file with all positions that are not in the VCF...
